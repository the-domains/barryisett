Barry Isett & Associates (BIA) is a multi-discipline firm that can provide single-source engineering and start-to-finish project involvement in the design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and replacement of facilities. 

Company ownership sets us apart from other qualified firms as virtually all project teams include company owners. Founded by Barry E. Isett, PE, PLS, F.NSPE in 1977, BIA is now owned by a consortium of associate shareholders, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), and Mr. Isett. Teams have an owner's interest in achieving project success. 

Both our firm and founder have been honored by peers and professional organizations for our contributions to our profession, but our greatest satisfaction comes from the on-going relationships we have developed with clients in many different fields: private industry, Fortune 500 companies, residential and commercial real estate, federal and state agencies, municipalities, healthcare providers, educational institutions...the list goes on. 

We are pleased to help with anything ranging from surveys or environmental assessments to a total package of engineering and technical services. We invite you to explore our site.
